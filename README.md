## Democracy. Guaranteed 

Bringing democracy to the blockchain. Ensuring that the people have a say in the decisions that affect them, with a system that is secure, transparent, and fair. Citizens will be verified and able to vote on issues that affect them. The system will be secure and transparent, with the results of the vote being publicly available. The system will be fair, with no one person or group having more influence than any other. Welcome to the future of democracy. Welcome to BlockRacy; work in progress.


## The Vision

### Verifiable Identity

Citizens will be verified using a secure and transparent system. This will ensure that only those who are eligible to vote are able to do so. This will also ensure that each person is only able to vote once. Blockchains are a decentralised, secure, and transparent way to ensure the system is fair and works for all.

### Secure Voting

Blockchains are secure and transparent, utitlising them we can ensure that everyones vote is not only counted, but also transparent. You can see the policies which people really care about, and the results of the vote will be publicly available. 

### Decentralised Governance

No one person or group will have more influence than any other. This will ensure that the system is fair and works for all. Inpenetrable to foreign influence, which is increasingly important in the digital age.
