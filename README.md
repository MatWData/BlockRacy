# BlockRacy
## Democracy. Guaranteed 

Bringing democracy to the blockchain. Ensuring that the people have a say in the decisions that affect them, with a system that is secure, transparent, and fair. Citizens will be verified and able to vote on issues that affect them. The system will be secure and transparent, with the results of the vote being publicly available. The system will be fair, with no one person or group having more influence than any other. Welcome to the future of democracy. Welcome to BlockRacy; work in progress.


## The Vision

### Verifiable Identity

Citizens will be verified using a secure and transparent system. This will ensure that only those who are eligible to vote can do so. This will also ensure that each person is only able to vote once. Blockchains are a decentralised, secure, and transparent way to ensure the system is fair and works for all.

### Secure Voting

Blockchains are secure and transparent, utilising them we can ensure that everyone's vote is not only counted but also transparent. You can see the policies which people care about, and the results of the vote will be publicly available. 

### Decentralised Governance

No one person or group will have more influence than any other. This will ensure that the system is fair and works for all. Impenetrable to foreign influence, which is increasingly important in the digital age. 


If you want to get involved, please reach out. I know there has been a lot of talk about voting on the blockchain - some negative. But frankly, I don't care. I want a safe and transparent place to gain a reliable census of the opinions of the nation. We as democracies can do better than what is going on right, whether we have to force our governments to listen to us then so be it. We are free after all.
